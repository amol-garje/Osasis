            <h2>What is Cloud computing ?</h2>

            <p> In server room, there should be a database server, mail server, networking, firewalls, routers, modem,
                switches, QPS (Query Per Second means how much queries or load will be handled by the server),
                configurable system, high net speed, and
                the maintenance engineers. To establish such IT infrastructure, we need to spend lots of money. To
                overcome all these problems and to reduce the IT infrastructure cost, Cloud Computing comes into
                existence.</p>
